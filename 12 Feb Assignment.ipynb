    "In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. Whenever an error occurs, Python generates an exception object, which contains information about the error, such as the type of error and where it occurred in the code. The program can then handle the exception by catching it and taking appropriate action, such as displaying an error message or exiting the program gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common types of exceptions in Python include:\n",
    "\n",
    "ValueError: raised when an operation or function receives an argument of the correct type but with an inappropriate value.\n",
    "TypeError: raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type.\n",
    "IndexError: raised when an index is out of range.\n",
    "KeyError: raised when a dictionary key is not found.\n",
    "NameError: raised when a variable is not found in the local or global scope.\n",
    "The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors in Python is that syntax errors occur during the parsing or compilation of the program, whereas exceptions occur during the execution of the program. Syntax errors are caused by violations of the Python syntax rules, such as incorrect indentation, missing or mismatched parentheses, or misspelled keywords. They prevent the program from running at all, whereas exceptions occur during the program's execution and can be handled by the program. Another key difference is that syntax errors are typically detected by the Python interpreter before the program is run, while exceptions can occur at any time during the program's execution.\n"

This error message will provide information about the type of exception that was raised, the line of code where the exception occurred, and a traceback of the call stack leading up to the exception. The program will then exit, and any remaining code will not be executed.\n",
    "    In this example, the program attempts to divide the number 10 by zero, which is not a valid operation and will raise a ZeroDivisionError exception. However, the program does not have a try-except block to handle this exception, so the exception will not be caught and will cause the program to terminate.\n",
